# GB Difference Calculator

A tiny JavaScript app to compute the difference between two drive data values (in GB). Useful when adding or removing files to see how the total changed.

## Features
- Enter **Old Drive Data (GB)** and **New Drive Data (GB)**.
- Calculates the absolute difference and whether space increased or decreased.
- Simple, zero-dependency HTML/CSS/JS.

## How it works
1. User inputs two numbers (old and new) in GB.
2. JS parses values, computes `difference = new - old`.
3. Shows result and a short message (e.g., "Added 12.5 GB" or "Removed 3.0 GB").

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
